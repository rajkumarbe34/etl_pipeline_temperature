1) Include automate HIVE table creation in to the pipeline to make access to the incremental Data through table.  This external table need to be dropped & created every day run to adopt dynamic schema changes. Modification required from Docker & Pipeline project. It will helpful to the data scientist & ML team to make it easy to read & analyse the structured data.
2) Establish Qlik dashboards out of the table to monitor the data quality and data availability.
3) Add montly aggregations out of the result from this pipeline's output.
4) Standardize Docker containers to handle in better way which includes Spark,Hive,Jenkins,Nexus and Airflow.
5) Include CI/CD to automate the build & deployment process.
